# Mariocasted Bot
A repository for [@mariocasted](https://twitter.com/mariocasted), a Twitter bot composed using [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/). Created to expand my portfolio for Creative Coding (DGST 302) at the University of Mary Washington.

## Background and Function
The bot itself is inspired by the internet meme associated with the controversial casting of Chris Pratt as Mario in the upcoming untitled 2022 Super Mario Bros. movie. Using two lists, one of celebrities and another of characters (each having an image corresponding with them), a Tweet is posted selecting a random index from both.


An example [@mariocasted](https://twitter.com/mariocasted) Tweet:

## Feats, Struggles, and Reflection
[@mariocasted](https://twitter.com/mariocasted) builds off of my work with [@Arbucklebot](https://twitter.com/ArbuckleBot) by further incorporating images and centralizing the general concept around an internet meme. The bot itself gathers its images from two separate Twitter accounts, [@mariosmirror](https://twitter.com/mariosMirror) for celebrities and [@mariohitlist](https://twitter.com/mariohitlist) for characters. The code itself for [@mariocasted](https://twitter.com/mariocasted)  is rather simple, but given that it works with a set amount of images, repetition is bound to happen. Ultimately, this is the bot's largest flaw and what I hope to improve in the future by taking a name and image from databases to create limitless combinations. In the meantime, I will continue to add more characters and celebrities to reduce said repetition.
